Abstract  
Primary Microcephaly (MCPH) is a disorder manifested as a reduction in head circumference and this clinical finding
infers that an individual has a significant diminution in brain volume. In Primary Microcephaly the brain fails to grow to
the correct size during pregnancy. The analysis show that the Fanconi anemia pathway that is required for the efficient
repair of damaged DNA is crutial for the disease. Mutations of analysed seed genes could have an impact, for instance
on the mitotic spindle orientation or on the signalling responses, because of the damaged DNA, and further leading to
the primary microcephaly disease. Among the putative disease genes modules obtained through the whole analysis,
some of the genes from MCPH1-MCPH12 loci were also found.
